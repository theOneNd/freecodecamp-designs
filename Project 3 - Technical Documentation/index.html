      <p>This page is dedicated to summarize what has so far happened in the world renowned series called One Piece. It is also going to summarize what is so far known about the legendary treasure called the One Piece. More than 1150 chapters in and we are not even close to it yet. Recent arcs started delving into and explaining certain things about the One Piece (though nothing relevant), the infamous "God-Valley Incident" and the mysteries surrounding the so called "Void Century". Let's start with the void century.</p>
      <p>To start with, the Void Century is a 100 year gap of time from which all history of this time has been erased. It is as big of a mystery as the One Piece itself. As for the God Valley Incident, it is an incident that led to the defeat of one of the most infamous Pirates to have ever existed called Rocks D. Xebec and the disappearance of the island of God Valley.</p>
      <p>All of these mysteries captivated fans for more than 20 years and has them still waiting for answers. But not to get off topic, One Piece follows a young pirate called Monkey D. Luffy, a man who hopes to find the legendary treasure and become "King of the Pirates". We shall look at everything he and his crew have gone through up to this point and all that was revealed to us fans along the way. </p>

      <p>The first saga is the starting point for main character Monkey D. Luffy and his journey for the One Piece. As it starts out, it tells us that there once lived a man called Gol D. Roger, the man known to the world as the 'King of the Pirates'. Just before getting executed, he told the world that he left his treasure in one place and whoever wants it can go find it. This kiced starts the 'Great Pirate Era'. After some 20 years have passed, and still no one who has found it, Luffy set out to find it.</p>
      <p>Here is a summary of the arcs for this saga:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Romance Dawn Arc</strong>: Luffy sets sail to become Pirate King and meets Zoro and Koby—launching the journey.</li>
        <li><strong>Orange Town Arc</strong>: The Straw Hats face off against Buggy the Clown, and Nami joins the crew. </li>
