      <p>This page is dedicated to summarize what has so far happened in the world renowned series called One Piece. It is also going to summarize what is so far known about the legendary treasure called the One Piece. More than 1150 chapters in and we are not even close to it yet. Recent arcs started delving into and explaining certain things about the One Piece (though nothing relevant), the infamous "God-Valley Incident" and the mysteries surrounding the so called "Void Century". Let's start with the void century.</p>
      <p>To start with, the Void Century is a 100 year gap of time from which all history of this time has been erased. It is as big of a mystery as the One Piece itself and has been declared illegal to try and look into it by the World Government (leading body of authority around the world). As for the God Valley Incident, it is an incident that led to the defeat of one of the most infamous Pirates to have ever existed called Rocks D. Xebec and the disappearance of the island of God Valley.</p>
      <p>All of these mysteries captivated fans for more than 20 years and has them still waiting for answers. But not to get off topic, One Piece follows a young pirate called Monkey D. Luffy, a man who hopes to find the legendary treasure and become "King of the Pirates". We shall look at everything he and his crew have gone through up to this point and all that was revealed to us fans along the way. </p>

      <header>East Blue Saga</header>
      <p>The first saga is the starting point for main character Monkey D. Luffy and his journey for the One Piece. As it starts out, it tells us that there once lived a man called Gol D. Roger, the man known to the world as the 'King of the Pirates'. Just before getting executed, he told the world that he left his treasure in one place and whoever wants it can go find it. This kiced starts the 'Great Pirate Era'. After some 20 years have passed, and still no one who has found it, Luffy set out to find it.</p>
      <p>Here is a summary of the arcs for this saga:</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="alabasta">
      <header>Alabasta Saga</header>
      <p>They have entered the Grand Line! The mysterious area which separates the 4 seas (North Blue, East Blue, South Blue, and the West Blue) along side the Red Line - a large sum of islands perpendicular to the grand line. The main story of this saga follows the Straw Hats helping Vivi Nefertari, the princess of Alabasta, return safely to her home and defeat the pirate warlord known as Crocodile - the man who plunged the kingdom of Alabasta into a deep political crisis.</p>
      <p>Here is a summary of the arcs for this saga:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Reverse Mountain Arc</strong>: Entry into the Grand Line via a dangerous sea passage.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisky Peak Arc</strong>: The crew is ambushed by bounty hunters tied to Baroque Works.</li>
        <li><strong>Little Garden Arc</strong>: On a prehistoric island, they meet two giant warriors.</li>
        <li><strong>Drum Island Arc</strong>: Chopper is recruited while saving the island's ruler from Wapol.</li>
        <li><strong>Arabasta Arc</strong>: A massive showdown against Crocodile and Baroque Works to save a kingdom of Alabasta. In the end, the Straw Hats were joined by a woman called Nico Robin.</li>
      </ol>
      <code>During the Reverse Mountain Arc, they got to meet the former doctor of the King of the Pirates. He told them their journey will end when they find the last island called 'Laughtale'. It is there they would supposedly find the One Piece treasure. 
        <br><br>
        During the Alabasta Arc, it was discovered that ancient stone blocks called 'Poneglyphs' exist. They are a thing of the past marked with symbols (ancient writing) that almost no one can decipher. The wanted woman Nico Robin is currently the only known person who can read them. Their existence is a mystery as it is believed that they hold clues about the void century. Its content wasn't revealed

    <section class="main-section" id="sky_island">
      <header>Sky Island Saga</header>
      <p>This Saga provided as with a lot of exposition about the world of One Piece; it introduced as to the likes of Blackbeard, Whitebeard (one of the 4 emperors of the seas, considered to be the strongest pirates alive), the Gorosei (5 elder stars)...</p>
      <p>Here is a summary of the arcs for this saga:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Jaya Arc</strong>: They search for clues about a floating island while clashing with Bellamy.</li>
        <li><strong>Skypiea Arc</strong>: Adventure on a sky island embroiled in ancient conflicts and Angel/Montblanc family drama.</li>
      </ol>
      <code>Robin found another one of the poneglyphs in Sky Island, which had the Pirate King's mark on it. It implied the existence of 'Road Poneglyphs' - special set of poneglyphs that when put together would reveal the location of the final island Laughtale.</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="water_7">
      <header>Water 7 Saga</header>
      <p>A incredible saga which involved heartbreak, separations, and the Straw Hats' dedication to each of their members. Forced by the undercover unit Cipher Pol 9 to abandon the Straw Hats and frame them, Nico Robin was coerced into abandoning her life so their lives would be sparred. She was also the last surivor of Ohara (the island of Scholars) after the World Government systematically killed every one there for daring to look into the void century. Moved by her reasons and her horrible past, the Straw Hats broke into one of the World Government's most important islands in hopes to rescue her.</p>
      <p>Here is a summary of the arcs for this saga:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Long Ring Long Land Arc (Davy Back Fight)</strong>: Silly pirate games with the Foxy Pirates—hinted to be more meaningful later and narrative importance reinterpreted in recent chapters.</li>
        <li><strong>Water 7 Arc</strong>: Crew confronts CP9, Robin’s tragic past revealed, and Franky introduced.</li>
        <li><strong>Enies Lobby Arc</strong>: Full-scale assault to rescue Robin. Going Merry is unable to xontinue and so was given a farewell.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-Enies Lobby Arc</strong>: Straw Hats gain world wide notoriety after facing the World Government, bounties increase, Franky joins, and a new ship—Thousand Sunny—born.</li>
      </ol>
      <code>The Scholars of Ohara, before been wiped out, uncovered key information regarding the void century. There once existed an ancient kingdom whose name was lost to history. The void century ended after their defeat and led to the formation of the World Government from the alliance of 20 kings. In wake of their defeat, the ancient Kingdom made sure to leave behind writings of what happened in stones called Poneglyphs. 
        <br><br>
        The Poneglyphs are then revealed to be indestructible. One would wonder why so. It was because they had an enemy. In order to ensure the survival of their legacy the poneglyphs were distributed across the world entrusted to their allies of old.</code>
