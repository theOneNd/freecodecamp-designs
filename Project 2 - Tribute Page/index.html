      <h2 id="early-life">Early Life</h2>
      <p><span class="bold">Born</span>: July 10, 1856 — Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia)</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Died</span>: January 7, 1943 — New York City, USA</p>
      <p>Nikola Tesla was born to Serbian parents and displayed a brilliant memory and imagination from a young age. He studied electrical engineering in Austria and later moved to the U.S. in 1884 with little more than a letter of introduction to Thomas Edison. Though he briefly worked for Edison, he soon struck out on his own to revolutionize the world with his ideas. Despite dying penniless, his inventions power modern civilization — from the electricity in our homes to wireless technologies. Advocated for <span class="emphasis">clean energy</span>, <span class="emphasis">free power</span>, and a future where <span class="emphasis">technology served humanity</span>, not profit. His ideas continue to inspire scientists, inventors, environmentalists, and futurists.</p>

      <h2 id="unfinished-dreams">Unfinished Dreams</h2>
      <p>Tesla had many visionary ideas that were ahead of his time, some of which remain unrealized:</p>
      <ol>
        <figure id="img-div">
          <img class="image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Tesla_Broadcast_Tower_1904.jpeg/330px-Tesla_Broadcast_Tower_1904.jpeg" alt="Wardenclyffe Tower">
          <p class="img-captions">Tesla's Wardenclyffe plant on Long Island in 1904</p>
        </figure>
        <li class="bold">Wireless Power Transmission</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Envisioned a world where electricity could be transmitted wirelessly over long distances.</li>
          <li>Conducted experiments with the Wardenclyffe Tower, which aimed to provide free, wireless energy globally.</li>
          <li>Project abandoned in 1906 after J.P. Morgan withdrew funding when he realized there would be no way to meter or profit from free energy. The tower was eventually demolished in 1917.</li>
          <li>Although the project was never completed, it inspired future research into wireless energy transfer.</li>
        </ul> 
        
        <li class="bold">Global Communication System</li>
        <ul>
          <li>It was his ultimate vision</li>
          <li>Proposed a global communication system that would allow people to communicate wirelessly anywhere in the world.</li>
          <li>Envisioned a network of towers that would transmit information, news, and entertainment wirelessly. It would ultimately enable real-time communication anywhere on Earth.</li>
          <li>While the internet has achieved some of these goals, Tesla’s vision of a truly global, free communication system remains unfulfilled.</li>
        </ul>

        <li class="bold">Death Ray (Teleforce)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Proposed a particle beam weapon that could project a beam of energy to destroy aircraft and other targets.</li>
            <li>He called it "Teleforce" — not a laser, but a high-velocity stream of particles.</li>
            <li>Claimed it could be used for defense, but the concept was never realized.</li>
            <li>Although Tesla filed patents for this technology, it was never developed or used in warfare.</li>
            <li>No working prototype was ever found, though some believe fragments may have been confiscated after his death. This fueled conspiracy theories about secret weapons and government cover-ups.</li>
          </ul>

        <li class="bold">Flying Machines / Anti-Gravity Aircraft</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Envisioned flying machines that could defy gravity and travel at incredible speeds.</li>
            <li>Proposed designs for aircraft that would use electromagnetic propulsion or anti-gravity technology.</li>
            <li>While Tesla’s ideas were never realized, they inspired future generations of inventors and scientists to explore advanced propulsion systems.</li>
            <li>Some speculate that his work on electromagnetic fields could have led to breakthroughs in anti-gravity technology, but no concrete evidence exists.</li>
          </ul>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
      <p>Tesla obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions. The Tesla electric car company was named in his honor. Since then, he has received numerous posthumous honors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>SI unit of magnetic flux density: the tesla (T)</li>
        <li>Inducted into the Inventors Hall of Fame</li>
        <li>Depicted in films, books, and pop culture</li>
